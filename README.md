# NearIT UI for iOS
NearIT-UI is an open-source library that provides customizable UI bindings on top of the core [NearIT SDK](https://github.com/nearit/iOS-SDK).
This library aims to minimize the effort of creating UI for NearIT contents and dialogs.

For example, using NearIT UI, a developer can launch a dialog for requesting the user location/notifications permissions by adding a few lines of code.
